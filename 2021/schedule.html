                <!-- <li><STRONG><mark>Formal Engineering Methods for Software Quality Assurance</mark> (Prof. Shaoying

                <p>
                    Conventional software engineering based on informal or semi-formal methods are facing tremendous
                    challenges in ensuring software quality.
                    Formal methods have attempted to address those challenges by introducing mathematical notation and
                    calculus to support formal specification, refinement,
                    and verification in software development. However, in spite of their theoretical potential in
                    improving the controllability of software process and reliability,
                    formal methods are difficult to apply to large-scale and complex systems in practice due to many
                    constraints
                    (e.g., limited expertise, complexity, changing requirements).
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Formal Engineering Methods" (FEM) has been proposed and developed as a research area since 1997 to
                    study how formal methods can be effectively integrated into
                    conventional software engineering process to improve software productivity and quality in practice.
                    A specific representative FEM
                    called Structured Object-Oriented Formal Language (SOFL) has also be developed over the last two
                    decades that offers three rigorous
                    but practical techniques for system modeling and verification: three-step formal specification
                    approach, specification-based
                    inspection, and specification-based testing. The effective combination of these three techniques can
                    significantly enhance software
                    productivity and quality.

                    Human-Cyber-Physical Systems (HCPS) is a combination of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) with ubiquitous
                    computing
                    (also known as intelligent environment) and social systems, including social computing. In HCPS,
                    humans as
                    individuals or unorganized and organized crowds deeply involved in interactions with physical and
                    cyber
                    systems, and operation and control of physical processes and hardware dynamically shift between
                    humans and
                    machines. The theory and methods of HCPS is still in its infancy, and research is needed to
                    establish its
                    scientific foundation so as to make advances in its engineering methods.

                    In this short course, we reflect the development of software engineering through software
                    abstractions and
                    show that these abstractions are integral in the notion of software system architectures. We discuss
                    that
                    it is important to engineer systems using formal methods in relation to the definition and
                    management of
                    development processes, and argue how a model of the software architecture, with rich semantics and
                    refinement
                    relations, plays an important role in this process. We recall the traditional separation of
                    processes for
                    domain modelling and software requirements modelling in model-driven software development. We then
                    propose
                    to combine these modelling approaches and this naturally leads to a unified process for HCPS
                    architecture
                    modelling, design, and evolution. Based on the unified processes, we outline a framework in
                    engineering
                    formal methods for HCPS modelling, with the discussion about significant challenges including
                    integration,
                    composition, collaboration, verification of HCPS with multi-dimensional heterogeneity. Human
                    components,
                    as well as all kinds of artificial intelligent systems, are particularly major courses of the
                    heterogeneity.

                    Significant progress has been made in the development of deep neural networks (DNNs), which now
                    outperform humans in several difficult tasks, such as image classification,
                    natural language processing, and two-player games. Given the prospect of a broad deployment of DNNs
                    in a wide range of applications,
                    concerns regarding the safety and trustworthiness of DNNs have been raised. In this lecture series,
                    I will review two threads of
                    existing research towards safety certification of DNNs. The first thread is on the formal
                    verification. In particular,
                    I will focus on constraint-based methods, approximation techniques, and anytime algorithms. The
                    second thread of research
                    is on the safety assurance of DNNs through testing- based method. This is based on an established
                    approach that has been
                    recommended in industrial standards such as ISO26262 for automotive software and DO178B/C for
                    avionic software, and it has
                    been adapted for DNNs.

                    University of Oxford and the University of New South Wales in Australia.
                    Dr Huang's research is concerned with the development of automated verification techniques that
                    ensure the correctness and reliability
                    of intelligent systems. His recent research on the verification of deep learning systems addresses a
                    major concern recently raised by
                    both the general public and the governments on the safety and robustness of deep learning systems.
                    Dr Huang has given a number of
                    invited talks on the trustworthiness and safety of machine learning techniques and their application

                <p>
                    Deep neural networks have emerged as a widely used and effective means for tackling complex,
                    real-world problems.
                    However, a major obstacle in incorporating them as controllers in safety-critical systems is the
                    great
                    difficulty in providing formal guarantees about their behavior. In recent years, attempts have been
                    made
                    to address this obstacle by formally verifying neural networks. However, neural network verification
                    is a
                    computationally difficult task, and traditional verification techniques have often had only limited
                    success
                    - leading to the development of novel techniques. In this series of talks we will survey the state
                    of the
                    art in neural network verification, focusing on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) based
                    approaches and
                    on abstraction/refinement based methods. Additionally, we will survey recent advances in the
                    verification
                    of recurrent neural networks. Finally, we will discuss the applicability of neural network
                    verification,
                    going over examples that include airborne collision avoidance, neural network simplification, and
                    the
                    verification of rate control algorithms.
